The widget displays the latest posts using custom markup which can be completely changed. It doesn't add anything
else (stylesheets, javascripts etc.) to the page.

== Description ==

The plugin adds a widget, which displays the latest posts using custom markup. The markup can be completely edited in
the widget's admin form.
To include post information, special tags are available, which can be included user-defined. All available tags are
listed in the section **Tags**.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin WP Last Posts Widget from this page and extract it
2. Copy the extracted folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Add the widget in the 'Theme->Widget' menu of your page.

== FAQ ==

= I can't find the Widget section in my theme's options =
Maybe your theme doesn't support widgets. In this case, the widgets-option is not available. To use this plugin
anyway, you must switch your theme to one which has widget-functionality or add widget-functionality by yourself
(just for experienced developers).
